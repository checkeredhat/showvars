This plugin simplifies the debugging process by displaying essential variables in a clean, easy-to-read modal window. To activate the debugger, simply append ?showvars=1 to any URL on your WordPress site.

For security, the debugger will only be displayed to users with administrator privileges.

When triggered, a modal window will overlay the current page, presenting a comprehensive list of:

GET Data: Information sent to the server via the URL.
POST Data: Information sent from forms on your website.
Server Variables: A wide range of information about the server environment, headers, and configuration.
File Uploads: Data related to any files uploaded.
Cookies: Data stored in the user's browser for your site.
Session Information: Variables stored on the server for the user's session.
Environment Variables: System-level variables available to WordPress.
Cloudflare Headers: If your site is behind Cloudflare, it will conveniently display specific Cloudflare headers.
