This plugin simplifies the debugging process by displaying essential variables in a clean, easy-to-read modal window. To activate the debugger, simply append ?showvars=1 to any URL on your WordPress site.<br>
<br>
For security, the debugger will only be displayed to users with administrator privileges.<br>
<br>
When triggered, a modal window will overlay the current page, presenting a comprehensive list of:<br>
<br>
GET Data: Information sent to the server via the URL.<br>
POST Data: Information sent from forms on your website.<br>
Server Variables: A wide range of information about the server environment, headers, and configuration.<br>

Cookies: Data stored in the user's browser for your site.<br>
Session Information: Variables stored on the server for the user's session.<br>
Environment Variables: System-level variables available to WordPress.<br>
Cloudflare Headers: If your site is behind Cloudflare, it will conveniently display specific Cloudflare headers.<br><br>
